Aadhaar Data Analysis Report
============================

This report summarizes the analysis of merged Aadhaar data from enrolment, demographic, and biometric datasets.

Data Sources:
- api_data_aadhar_enrolment_500000_1000000.csv
- api_data_aadhar_demographic_500000_1000000.csv
- api_data_aadhar_biometric_1000000_1500000.csv

Merged into: merged_aadhar_data.csv

Methodology:
Extremely high enrolment rates were treated as anomalies caused by missing or mismatched population values and were analysed separately.

Analysis 1: High Enrolment Areas vs Population
==============================================

Certain areas exhibited enrolment rates exceeding 100%, which are unrealistic and likely due to data inconsistencies such as missing or inaccurate population figures. These anomalies were identified primarily in states like Meghalaya, Jammu & Kashmir, Orissa, Nagaland, and Bihar, suggesting potential regional data quality issues or specific enrolment patterns. The focus is on recognizing these as outliers rather than precise metrics, highlighting the need for data validation.

Analysis 2: Age Group Distribution vs Biometric Updates
======================================================

Biometric update rates relative to enrolment showed patterns across age groups. Younger age groups (5-17) had lower relative update activity, while older age groups (17+) demonstrated significantly higher update rates compared to their enrolment numbers. This indicates a trend where adults engage more in biometric updates, possibly due to verification requirements or life changes.

Interpretation:
- Older age groups show a pattern of higher biometric update activity relative to enrolment, suggesting increased engagement in updates for verification or corrections.
- This could reflect demographic factors where adults are more likely to require biometric adjustments over time.

Recommendations:
- Investigate data quality for areas with extremely high enrolment rates to address anomalies.
- Consider regional and demographic factors influencing enrolment and biometric updates.
- Further analysis could explore time-series trends or correlations with other factors to understand underlying patterns.
